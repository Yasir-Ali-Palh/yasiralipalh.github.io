    <h2>The P-39 - A Weapon in Skilled Hands</h2>
    <img src="images/p39.jpg" alt="A Bell P-39 WW2 fighter aircraft" />
    <p>The P-39 was a fighter aircraft which served in the second world war. It was quite a distinctive aircraft, in that unlike its contemporaries it had car-like doors instead of a sliding canopy and its engine was installed behind the cockpit instead of infront of it. It served with US in the Pacific theatre and it was also land-leased to the USSR. The US pilots bad-mouthed it because it was hard to gain an advantage over the Japanese Zero with it, only a select few distinguished pilots were able to succeed in it. The Soviets on the other hand had a much better time with it. It mainly served in the Caucasus, where the fighting took place mostly at a lower altitude. The Soviets also removed two of its machine-guns in order to save weight. Both German and Soviet pilots agreed that it was a formidable fighter in the hands of a skilled pilot. A German pilot even said that it was the best Soviet fighter in service. Eventually, as the war drew on, it was replaced by more advanced fighters.</p>
